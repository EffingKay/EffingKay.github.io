Case study of my first portfolio page.

This portfolio page was created prior to my General Assembly course, I made it after a few month of self learning as an exercise to improve. It was a great challenge as I haven't used Jekyll or Github pages before, it was also a first time I used Markdown or Liquid to create a site.


It was a simple three page site consinsiting of Home page, Work page and Contact page with an animated modal menu for which I used a modal jQuery plugin. See the menu below:

The portfolio page used a jQuery accordion and was fairly simple. At the time of creation I only had a few projects for Free Code Camp. Every project contained a name, short description and technologies used plus a link button which forwarded you to a Codepen of that project.

Contact page proved to be a biggest challenge at that time as it consisted of a contact form and as a beginner I didn't had enough knowledge to made form functional. However, I found Formspree - a service that forward all messages from your form to your email. Once I implemented that into the page, I only added links to my profiles on a different social medias.

Looking back now, I was very simple site but having to use Jekyll for the first time, needing to download all the dependencies and make sure everything works on Github pages, it was a very challenging exercise for a beginner.
Having said that, I felt it was a huge win to deploy it to Github pages and see it online and working.
