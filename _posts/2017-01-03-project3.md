Case study of my third and group project for GA.

Create a MEAN app with user authentication and deploy it to Heroku while working in a team of 5.

## What was used

AngularJS, SASS and Skeleton framework were used for client side styling, while Express and MongoDB were used on server side.

Gulp was used as task runner.

We used Google Books API.

## Overview

Our Angular app enabled users to leave a book anywhere in London, register it on its site and track its progress from the comments of other people who found it. It was a way to build a narrative around the object of the book itself. We decided to make Free The Books a mock activist movement whose aim was to free books from the tyranny of shelves. We styled the app after Communist propaganda posters and I wrote us a manifesto that drew inspiration from the tenets of Fight Club.

I was responsible for several aspects of this project, namely 'I found a book' page (showed above), where you enter book's code which redirects you to a book show page, allowing you to comment on the book. You can only add comment about a book if you came from this page.

Another aspect I was responsible for was a unique code rendering, which is only showed to you if you release a book, making it yours. No other user can't see the code besides you.

I also teamed up with one of my classmates to set up the back end. We were responsible for Express app and all the packages, we also set up the database and initial models.

The book index was a group effort, we used a Angular Slick carousel for Freedom Feed and we render all books ever released under it.

## What was a challenge?

Teamwork and coordination proved to be a biggest challenge duing this project. It was a first time any of us worked in a development team, we used Trello for work coordination and git for version control just as we were advised.

## What was a win?
We ended with a functional website, it was a first time we used AngularJS in a project, only after a week of studying Angular in a class.

## What I want to implement in the future
We discussed making the site live. We thought a printable code for users to stick on the book would be a nice touch.


## Known issues
- If logged out the book show page is broken
