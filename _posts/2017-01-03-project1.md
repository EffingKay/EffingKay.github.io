Case study of my first project for GA.

For our first project at GA we were asked to create a game and deploy it at Heroku.

[DEMO](http://grumpy-typing.herokuapp.com/) ||| [CODE](https://github.com/EffingKay/WDI_PROJECT_1) |||  [REFACTORED CODE](https://github.com/EffingKay/wdi-project-1-remastered) ||| [REFACTORED DEMO](http://typing-game.netlify.com/)

## Technologies used
The typing game I created is rendered in the browser with heroku and I used jQuery for interactivity, while I styled it with CSS.

## Overview

The game is played by one player. Upon commencing, the player can choose the level of difficulty from easy to hard. The objective of the game is to clear as many word as possible before the word reaches right side of the screen. The higher the levels, the faster the words render and move across the screen.

The high score is stored for every level individually.
